# This file is intentionally left empty. All calls to this bundle will
# be delegated to the parent bundle ValidationMessages (which contains
# Chinese messages).
#
# Not providing this bundle would cause the bundle for the default
# locale to take precedence over the base bundle. If the default locale
# is not Chinese but one, for which a resource bundle exists (e.g. German),
# the Chinese texts would never be returned.
